# alx-files_manager

```Back-end``` ```JavaScript``` ```ES6``` ```NoSQL``` ```MongoDB``` ```Reddis``` ```NodeJS``` ```Express``` ```Kue```

## Description
This project is a summary of this back-end trimester: authentication, NodeJS, MongoDB, Redis, pagination and background processing.

The objective is to build a simple platform to upload and view files:

    User authentication via a token
    List all files
    Upload a new file
    Change permission of a file
    View a file
    Generate thumbnails for images

You will be guided step by step for building it, but you have some freedoms of implementation, split in more files etc… (utils folder will be your friend)

Of course, this kind of service already exists in the real life - it’s a learning purpose to assemble each piece and build a full product.

Enjoy!
